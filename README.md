# XSS Vulnerability Demonstration

This project demonstrates two common types of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities:

1. **Reflected XSS**: A vulnerability where user input is reflected immediately in the response without proper sanitization.
2. **Stored XSS**: A vulnerability where malicious input is stored and executed later.

## Purpose

This code is intended for educational purposes only. It highlights the risks of unsanitized user input and demonstrates how attackers exploit XSS vulnerabilities.

### Features

- **Reflected XSS**: Simulates user input being reflected on the page.
- **Stored XSS**: Mimics the behavior of storing and displaying user comments without proper validation.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/xss-demo.git
